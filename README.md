# Data-Visualization-with-Python


Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

There are many data visualisations packages in Python that you can use. In this notebook, we will look into three of them: Matplotlib, Seaborne and Plotly.
